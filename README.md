# SALI&T

The Sal Area Lexicostatistical Inventory &amp; Typological dataset (SALI&amp;T, "sal-list") is an elicitation- and comparison-based word list based on Matisoff's (1978, 2000) _CALMSEA_ word list, itself presented as a "culturally appropriate" word list for South East Asia.

The SALI&T is further refined for Sal (Burling 0000) varietites in order to gather a slightly greater depth of concepts and stems than CALMSEA, with a primary focus on Bodo-Garo, Jinghpaw and Central Sal (Northern Naga) varieties. The list is meant to serve as both a tool to those undertaking documentation work in the region, as well as for phylogenetic analysis of Sal and related varieties in order to better categories relatedness within the cluster.
